# Custom Agents

This directory is reserved for future Cursor custom agent configurations.

Cursor supports creating custom agent modes with:
- Custom instructions
- Tool permissions
- Keybindings for quick activation

When you create custom agents in Cursor (Settings → Agents), you can reference project rules and skills. The rules in `.cursor/rules/` and skills in `.cursor/skills/` apply to all agents working in this project.
