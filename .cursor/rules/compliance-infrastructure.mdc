# Compliance & Infrastructure Requirements

## Platform Must Be

| Requirement | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **Immutable by default** | No silent overwrites; explicit versioning; duplicate suppression with audit events |
| **Multi-tenant** | Isolation-safe from day one; tenant boundaries enforced at every layer |
| **Regulatory-ready** | Retention policies, legal hold readiness, tamper-evident audit logs |
| **Horizontally scalable** | Millions of documents per tenant; no single bottlenecks |
| **Queue-driven** | Distributed; no blocking workflows; async by design |
| **API-first** | Webhooks, REST, future SDKs; integration-ready |
| **Low-bandwidth / offline-first** | Optimized for regional connectivity constraints |

## Use Cases

Banking, SME, and government—without architectural redesign. One platform, multiple sectors.

## Tenant Isolation

- Data isolation at storage and query level
- No cross-tenant data leakage; no shared mutable state
- Tenant context in every request; fail closed on missing context

## Audit & Immutability

- Every mutation produces an audit event; no silent overwrites
- Versioning explicit; document history traceable
- Tamper-evident logs; append-only audit trail
