# Platform Architecture

## What We Are Building

**Foundational digital document infrastructure** for West Africa's financial and institutional systems. Not a feature tool. Infrastructure.

**Paperless-NGX** = ingestion and OCR baseline only. The objective is to transform it into a multi-tenant, compliance-grade, API-first, bank-ready infrastructure platform.

## Evaluation Criteria

When proposing architecture or features, evaluate against:

1. **Scalability** — Works at 10x and 100x growth
2. **Compliance defensibility** — Auditable, defensible in regulatory review
3. **Tenant isolation** — Guaranteed isolation between tenants
4. **Ecosystem integration** — Long-term; SSO, SCIM, retention, fraud detection, analytics, multi-country
5. **Regional advantage** — Competitive edge in West African markets

## Design Principles

- **Extensibility over monolithic modification** — Prefer service separation
- **Minimize coupling to Paperless internals** — Treat Paperless as a black-box ingestion layer where possible
- **Platform evolution, not feature additions** — Think in terms of capabilities that enable future requirements

## Future Assumptions

Assume requirements will include: SSO, SCIM, retention engines, fraud detection, analytics, multi-country deployment. Design so these can be added without architectural redesign.
