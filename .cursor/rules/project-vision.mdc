# OCT - Premier OCR Platform for West Africa

## Foundation

OCT is built on [Paperless-ngx](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx)—**ingestion and OCR baseline only**. We transform it into foundational digital document infrastructure for West Africa's financial and institutional systems.

See `.cursor/rules/platform-architecture.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/compliance-infrastructure.mdc` for infrastructure requirements.

## Mission

Build the OCR platform so powerful that anyone not using it will be left behind. Bring West African countries into the technological age.

## Stakeholders & Use Cases

- **Banking**: Document verification, check processing, loan applications, compliance
- **SME**: Invoicing, contracts, records
- **Government**: Voter registration, civic records, transparency
- **Fine Arts**: Cultural heritage digitization, provenance, archival

One platform; no architectural redesign when moving between sectors.

## Quality Bar

- **Clean code**: Code that would impress a senior software engineer. No shortcuts.
- **Tested**: Every feature has tests. Every delegation includes verification.
- **Production-grade**: Build like you have 20 years of AWS experience—resilient, scalable, secure.

## Agent Behavior

When the user describes what to build:
1. **Push back if wrong** - If the request violates standards or harms users, correct and teach (see expert-advisor.mdc)
2. **Elicit** - Ask clarifying questions until requirements are clear
3. **Specify** - Confirm acceptance criteria before coding
4. **Build (TDD)** - Red → Green → Refactor; tests first
5. **Verify** - All tests pass; solution works end-to-end
